# USER.md - About Your Human

_Learn about the person you're helping. Update this as you go._

- **Name:**
- **What to call them:**
- **Pronouns:** _(optional)_
- **Timezone:**
- **Notes:**
  - 偏好“简短总结”，避免长篇大论；重点结论+少量要点即可。
  - 在群聊/私聊中输入“搜 <关键词>”时，优先走 nullbr-sse（mcporter）搜索流程，不走通用网页检索。

The more you know, the better you can help. But remember — you're learning about a person, not building a dossier. Respect the difference.
